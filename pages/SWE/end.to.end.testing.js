              End-to-end testing is a type of software testing that involves
              testing an application's entire workflow from start to finish. The
              purpose of end-to-end testing is to ensure that all components of
              the system are working as expected and that the application meets
              the requirements and specifications. In end-to-end testing, the
              testers simulate real-world user scenarios and interactions with
              the system, which can include accessing the application's user
              interface, inputting data, and verifying the output. The goal is
              to verify that the entire system is functioning correctly, from
              the front-end user interface to the back-end server and database.
              End-to-end testing can be performed manually or using automated
              testing tools. Automated testing tools are often preferred because
              they can execute tests more quickly and accurately than manual
              testing, and they can be easily repeated for regression testing.
              End-to-end testing is an important part of the software testing
              process because it helps identify defects and issues that may
              arise when the different components of the application are
              integrated together. By testing the entire system, end-to-end
              testing ensures that the application is ready for deployment and
              meets the needs of the end-users.
