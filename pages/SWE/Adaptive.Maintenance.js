              Emergency maintenance is a type of maintenance that is performed
              on equipment or systems when an unexpected failure or malfunction
              occurs that poses a threat to safety, health, or the environment.
              It is typically performed outside of normal maintenance schedules
              and may involve urgent repairs or replacement of critical
              components or systems. Emergency maintenance is important because
              it helps prevent accidents, injuries, and damage to equipment or
              property that can result from unexpected failures. It may involve
              shutting down production or operations temporarily to perform
              repairs or replacement, but this is necessary to ensure the safety
              of workers and the public. Examples of emergency maintenance may
              include repairing a gas leak in a building, replacing a faulty
              valve in a chemical processing plant, or repairing a critical
              component of an aircraft engine. Emergency maintenance should be
              performed by qualified professionals with the necessary equipment
              and expertise to ensure that repairs are done safely and
              effectively.
