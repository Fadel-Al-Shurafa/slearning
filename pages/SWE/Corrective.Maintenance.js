              <b>what is Corrective Maintenance?</b>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Corrective maintenance is a type of maintenance activity that is
              performed to correct a fault or defect in a system or equipment
              after it has failed or malfunctioned. This type of maintenance is
              reactive in nature and is carried out after the failure has
              occurred. The objective of corrective maintenance is to restore
              the system or equipment to its normal operating condition as
              quickly as possible to minimize downtime and reduce the risk of
              further damage or failure.
            </p>

            <p>
              Corrective maintenance involves diagnosing the problem,
              identifying the root cause of the failure, and taking appropriate
              action to fix the issue. This may include replacing faulty
              components, repairing damaged parts, or making adjustments to the
              system or equipment to restore its normal function. Corrective
              maintenance is often seen as a temporary fix and may not address
              the underlying issues that caused the failure in the first place,
              so it is important to also consider other maintenance strategies
              such as preventive maintenance to prevent similar failures from
              happening in the future.
