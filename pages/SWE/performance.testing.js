              Performance testing is a type of software testing that evaluates
              how a system or application performs under various conditions and
              workloads. The objective of performance testing is to measure the
              response time, throughput, scalability, reliability, and resource
              utilization of the system under different scenarios, such as high
              traffic, heavy load, or stress conditions.

              Performance testing can be conducted at different stages of the
              software development life cycle, including design, development,
              testing, and production. The primary goal of performance testing
              is to identify performance bottlenecks, optimization
              opportunities, and potential issues that can impact the system's
              performance in production.

              Performance testing typically involves creating realistic user
              scenarios and simulating a large number of virtual users to
              emulate the system's real-world usage. The results of the
              performance test are analyzed to identify performance issues, and
              the system is optimized to improve its performance, reliability,
              and scalability.

                system's performance in production. By simulating realistic user
                scenarios and workloads, performance testing can help identify
                issues related to slow response times, high CPU usage, memory
                leaks, and other performance-related problems.

                the demands of a growing user base. By testing the system's
                scalability under different scenarios, performance testing can
                help identify limitations and optimize the system's performance
                to ensure that it can handle a large number of users.
