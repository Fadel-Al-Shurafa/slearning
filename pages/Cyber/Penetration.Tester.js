                  A penetration tester, also known as a pentester, is a
                  cybersecurity professional who specializes in identifying and
                  exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and
                  applications. The goal of a penetration test is to simulate a
                  real-world attack scenario and identify weaknesses in an
                  organization's security defenses. This allows the organization
                  to remediate these flaws before they can be exploited by
                  attackers.
