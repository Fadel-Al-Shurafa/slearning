                  A Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is a senior-level
                  executive responsible for overseeing an organization's
                  information security program. The CISO is typically
                  responsible for developing and implementing policies and
                  procedures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and
                  availability of an organization's information assets, as well
                  as protecting against unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
                  disruption, modification, or destruction of those assets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The CISO works with other executives and stakeholders across
                  the organization to identify and manage information security
                  risks, establish security standards and protocols, and ensure
                  compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The CISO also
                  plays a key role in incident response and disaster recovery
                  planning, and may oversee the implementation of security
                  technologies and tools, as well as the training of employees
                  on security best practices.
