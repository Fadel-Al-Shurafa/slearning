                <h3><b>What is Machine Learning Engineering </b></h3>
                <p>
                  Machine learning engineering is a field of computer science that focuses on designing and developing algorithms
                  and models that enable computers to learn and make decisions. Machine learning engineers work with large
                  datasets and use statistical techniques to train models that can recognize patterns and make predictions. They
                  also work on developing algorithms that can improve over time based on new data. Machine learning engineers
                  work in a variety of industries, including healthcare, finance, and technology. They need to have a strong
                  background in computer science, mathematics, and statistics, as well as experience with programming
                  languages like Python and R.

              <h4><b>Data Analyst tasks and responsibilities</b></h4>
              <p> A data analyst is a person whose job is to gather and interpret data in order to solve a specific problem. The role includes plenty of
                time spent with data but entails communicating findings too.
              </p>
              <p><b>Here’s what many data analysts do on a day-to-day basis:</b></p>

              <ul>
                <li><b>Statistics: </b>Tools and tables are very essential in machine learning to create models from data.  Statistics and its branches such as analysis of variance and hypothesis testing are crucial for
                  building algorithms. As machine learning algorithms are built upon statistical models,  we can understand how important statistics is for
                  machine learning is. That's how statistics play an essential role in developing the algorithms. So it is very vital to gain knowledge on statistical tools to speed up your career in machine learning.</li>
                <li><b>Data Modeling: </b>The critical task of machine learning is to analyze the unstructured data models,  which requires the science of data modeling. Data modeling enables identifying the underlying
                  data structures, finding out the patterns, and filling the gaps between the places where data is nonexistent. Having explicit knowledge of data modeling concepts would help in creating efficient algorithms.</li>
                <li><b>Programming Fundamentals and CS: </b>Machine learning involves computation on large data sets; hence one should possess strong basic fundamental skills such as computer architecture, algorithms
                  , data structures, complexity, etc. Getting in-depth into the programming books and exploring new things will be a good advantage. Sign Up for some courses to sharpen your programming skills and to advance your knowledge.</li>
                <li><b>Interpret data:</b> As a machine learning engineer, you need not reinvent the wheel, all you need to do is using the algorithms and libraries that are developed by other developers and organizations.
                  There are a wide variety of API Packages and libraries such as Microsoft’s CNTK, Apache Spark’s MLlib, and Google TensorFlow. Applying these technologies will require a clear understanding of different concepts,
                  how they can be integrated with different systems, and the pitfalls that arise along the road</li>
                <li><b>Applying ML Libraries & Algorithms: </b> ML Programming Languages: One should certainly require programing knowledge skills to deal with machine learning projects, but the problem is which language
                  one should learn? To clarify this doubt let’s get into the details. Machine learning is not limited by any specific programing language, and it's more like object-oriented language. It would be developed in any
                  language which can meet the required components. Let’s discuss how each programming language listed below helps in developing machine learning.</li>
                <li><b>Python: </b>Python is one of the widely used programming languages in many fields; in fact, it is mostly preferred by data scientists and machine learning engineers. It is equipped with a wide range of useful
                  libraries which help in processing data efficiently and in scientific computing.
                  Python also supports a number of machine learning libraries such as Theano, TensorFlow, and sci-kit- learn, and these libraries make training algorithms very easier.</li>
                <li><b>R: </b>is a programming language developed for statistical computing and data mining, and these features enable it to be a perfect fit for machine learning tasks. There are many statistical models
                  and algorithms available in R for different computing tasks. When it comes to the syntax of R, it’s a bit different from other languages but is simple to learn.
                </li>
                <li><b>Interpret data:</b>C/C++: is generally used to program the interface and to develop the mechanisms of machine learning. The libraries available in all other languages can be firstly
                  developed in C/C++ and can be made available in all other languages with the help of API calls. C/C++ languages are mostly used to develop embedded systems, and it will help you to a great extent if you are planning
                  to get into the programing of Smart homes, smart cars, and sensor devices.</li>
