                  Machine learning engineering is a field of computer science
                  that focuses on designing and developing algorithms and models
                  that enable computers to learn and make decisions. Machine
                  learning engineers work with large datasets and use
                  statistical techniques to train models that can recognize
                  patterns and make predictions. They also work on developing
                  algorithms that can improve over time based on new data.
                  Machine learning engineers work in a variety of industries,
                  including healthcare, finance, and technology. They need to
                  have a strong background in computer science, mathematics, and
                  statistics, as well as experience with programming languages
