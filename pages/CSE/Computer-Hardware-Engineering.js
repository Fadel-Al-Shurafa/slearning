                  <b>What is a Computer Hardware Engineer?</b>
                </h3>
                <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1000">
                  A computer hardware engineer is responsible for designing,
                  developing, and testing computer hardware components such as
                  processors, memory, and motherboards. These engineers work on
                  the physical components of computer systems, ensuring that
                  they function properly and are compatible with other
                  components. They may also design custom hardware solutions for
                  specific applications.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Computer hardware engineers typically have a strong background
                  in electrical engineering, with a focus on digital and analog
                  circuit design. They must also be knowledgeable in computer
                  architecture, microprocessors, and digital signal processing.
                  In addition to design work, computer hardware engineers may be
                  responsible for troubleshooting and diagnosing hardware
                  problems, and for recommending and implementing hardware
                  upgrades. They may work for companies that manufacture
                  computer hardware or for organizations that use computer
                  systems in their operations, such as government agencies or
                  financial institutions.

                <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1000">
                  Hardware engineers usually work on computer systems,
                  components, and computerized products for consumer markets.
                  Their main duties include testing, modifying, and maintaining
                  the products they build.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Most components must work alongside networking and software
                  tools. Ensuring compatibility with networked systems and
                  specialized applications adds an additional level of
                  complexity to their work.
