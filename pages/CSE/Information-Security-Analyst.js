                  The twenty-first century has already seen large information
                  breaches at big companies in which sensitive data—including
                  the credit card numbers, passwords, and social security
                  numbers of hundreds of millions of users—were compromised.
                  Information security analysts work to protect organizations
                  from similar threats, preventing data hacks and breaches.
