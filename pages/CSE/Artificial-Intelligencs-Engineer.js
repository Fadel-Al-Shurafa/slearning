                <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1000">
                  Artificial intelligence engineers are individuals who use AI
                  and machine learning techniques to develop applications and
                  systems that can help organizations increase efficiency, cut
                  costs, increase profits, and make better business decisions.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  AI engineering focuses on developing the tools, systems, and
                  processes that enable artificial intelligence to be applied in
                  the real world. Any application where machines mimic human
                  functions, such as solving problems and learning, can be
                  considered artificial intelligence. Algorithms are “trained”
                  by data, which helps them to learn and perform better.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  You may have encountered the results of AI engineering when
                  you use Netflix, Spotify, or YouTube, where machine learning
                  customized suggestions based on your behavior. Another popular
                  example is in transportation, where self-driving cars are
                  driven by AI and machine learning technology. It’s especially
                  useful in the health care industry because AI can power robots
                  to perform surgery and generate automated image diagnoses.
